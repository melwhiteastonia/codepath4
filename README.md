## Overview
### Description
In our app,'Calendar', users can create calendar events and daily tasks on the go.  User's can preview, depending on the view ,which consists of the day, week, or month's prospective, if a day contains an event and click on it to learn more information. Users can also devise a list of daily tasks on a todo list. Items from this list can be added, deleted and modified to the user's wishes. 

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Productivity
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily used on mobile devices so the user can create events and tasks on the go. In future developments, the app could be used on other devices(i.e. laptops, desktops) that would provide a greater view of the app. It could potentially include the most, if all, of the features of mobile devices.
- **Story:** Allows user to monitor events by day, week, or month. The events are displayed to the user, and the user can add tasks to a to do list.
- **Market:** This app is open for any individual to use.
- **Habit:** This app can be used daily to keep track of events and tasks.
- **Scope:** We would start with users creating events and tasks, and then eventually we could integrate API's to add location features that correspond with an event. Eventually events can be shared with others by email. This app has the potential to be interactive, productive, and multi-functional.
